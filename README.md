# PROG8245-PROJECT

### <b> Overview:</b>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;">
  The objective of this project is to apply Natural Language Processing techniques to perform
  a multiclass sentiment analysis on Amazon food reviews. Specifically, the project will:
</p>

<ul style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">
  <li>Collect and annotate a corpus of product reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.</li>
  <li>Carry out text preprocessing steps including tokenization, stop‑word removal, lowercasing, and stemming/lemmatization.</li>
  <li>Experiment with three distinct feature‑extraction methods (e.g., Bag‑of‑Words, TF‑IDF, and contextual embeddings such as BERT).</li>
  <li>Build and evaluate classification models (such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, or neural networks) on the extracted features.</li>
  <li>Compare model performance to determine the most effective embedding technique for review sentiment classification.</li>
  <li>Document the methodology, results, and insights, and present findings in a final report and live demonstration.</li>
</ul>
